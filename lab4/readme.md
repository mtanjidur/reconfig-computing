For some reason, the ModelSim test bench results do not agree with the software Zedboard programming results. All outputs are correct and `done` is properly asserted, but there is a one-cycle discrepancy between what is reported in ModelSim vs. C++. We talked with Dr. Stitt about this issue and he is unsure what is causing this. We are hoping since the outputs are correct, just delayed by one cycle in the test bench that partial credit is still warranted.

Thanks!
